        <h1>OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE PROJECT</h1>
        <h2>1. Make the bonus</h2>
        <p>The first thing you could improve would be to do the bonus.Indeed it can be interesting to launch the server
            as Daemon. So we could play anytime because the server would never stop.However, this would involve
            displaying errors and other information in a log file.The double <strong> fork () </strong> method explained
            in the subject of being quite simple to do. </p>
        <h2> 2.Make other games </h2>
        <p> In the subject, we had to make the Hangman game, but the purpose of this project is indeed to be able to
            launch the game of our choice from the client.We can imagine a whole bunch of play. For example a tetris, a
            solitary game, a game of quiz, failure etc.The possibilities are infinite. This would be necessary to make
            the project completely relevant.</p>
        <h2>3. Make multiplayer games </h2>
        <p>
            We could make multiplayer games using several clients simultaneously. It would be a big challenge to
            complete the project because it would not be easy. You have to think about synchronization, signal
            management, error management etc. For example, one can imagine a client-to-client chess game on two separate
            terminals. This would require a lot of effort because we should do network programming.It would be necessary
            to document a lot because we have never done it yet.In addition, it would require very high security.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Improve the client.</h2>
        <p>
            The client could be improved, in order to make a small interface that would leave the user's choice to
            choose a game among those available. It would be very interesting to implement this feature, and not very
            long to do. It could also be improved so that the user can choose the language of the game. We can also
            imagine a graphical interface for the client, taking up the ideas above.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Make the project Windows compatible</h2>
        <p>Currently, the project can only turn on Linux because there are system calls that only works on Linux.It
            would be a good training because we have never done system programming on Windows, everything is to be
            learned. We do not know at all how is managed on Windows signals, file system, permissions etc etc.
            Making the executable project on Windows will allow greater portatibility. However everything has to be redone.
